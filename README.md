# cpsc-329-project

This is repository for the Spring 2024 project made by:
- Thomas Boyko
- Sophia Moneva
- Yasna Naseri
- Weihan Song

The project contains a writeup for a new lab activity for the course; as well as a folder of python code that was used to test the exercises and could potentially be used in order to run the lab.

The main.pdf file in the RSAinfo folder contains the lab instructions, and the python files are in the python folder :).

There is also a folder ModularInfo. We began adding some information on modular arithmetic and its properties, however it is currently unfinished. However, it may provide a good starting point for someone who is unfamiliar with modular arithmetic. The pdf file is located in this folder.
